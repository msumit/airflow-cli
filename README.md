# Apache-Airflow-Cli

WIP Airflow CLI, which is a thin wrapper over its [Python Client Lib](https://github.com/msumit/airflow-client-python) 
which is genereated via OpenApi3 specifications. 

Make sure to install the client lib before installing this cli. To install this cli run `python setup.py install`. Once 
installed run `airflow-cli`, which as of now has support of running `dags list` command.
